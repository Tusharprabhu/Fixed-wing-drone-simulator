RUNWAY START SETUP - Place Plane Statically on Runway
======================================================

Follow these steps to start the plane on the runway instead of in the air:

STEP 1: POSITION THE PLANE ON RUNWAY
------------------------------------

1. In Unity Hierarchy, select the "F15" object

2. In Inspector, look at the Transform component:
   Current position: (0, 500, -2500) - This is in the air!

3. Change the Transform Position to start on runway:
   
   OPTION A - Find Runway Position:
   - Select "Runway" object in Hierarchy
   - Note its Transform Position (X, Y, Z)
   - Set F15 position to approximately:
     X: Same as runway X (or slightly offset)
     Y: Runway Y + 2 (just above the runway surface)
     Z: Runway start Z (or wherever you want to start)
   
   OPTION B - Estimated Runway Start:
   If runway is at ground level (Y ≈ 0), try:
   Position X: 0
   Position Y: 2 (just above ground)
   Position Z: -2500 (or adjust to runway start)
   
   Rotation:
   X: 0
   Y: 0 (facing forward along runway)
   Z: 0

4. Adjust Y position so landing gear touches the runway:
   - The plane should rest on its wheels
   - Typically Y = 2 to 5 depending on terrain height
   - You can use the Scene view to visually position it

STEP 2: SET INITIAL SPEED TO ZERO
----------------------------------

1. With "F15" still selected in Hierarchy

2. In Inspector, scroll down to find "Plane (Script)" component

3. Find the "Misc" section (expand it if collapsed)

4. Locate "Initial Speed" field (currently set to 200)

5. Change "Initial Speed" to: 0
   - This makes the plane start stationary
   - You'll need to use W key to build up speed for takeoff

STEP 3: ENABLE LANDING GEAR AND FLAPS (OPTIONAL)
-------------------------------------------------

For realistic runway start, you may want:

1. In "Plane (Script)" component, find "Misc" section

2. Check "Flaps Deployed" checkbox
   - This deploys flaps for better low-speed lift during takeoff
   - You can toggle them off with F key once airborne

3. Landing gear should already be configured in the "Landing Gear" list

STEP 4: ALIGN WITH RUNWAY DIRECTION
------------------------------------

1. Select "Runway" object to see which direction it points

2. Select "F15" again

3. In Transform, adjust Rotation Y to match runway direction:
   - Y = 0 → Facing North/Forward
   - Y = 90 → Facing East/Right
   - Y = 180 → Facing South/Backward
   - Y = 270 → Facing West/Left

4. Make sure the plane faces down the runway for takeoff!

STEP 5: TEST THE SETUP
-----------------------

1. Press Play ▶️ in Unity

2. The plane should:
   ✓ Be sitting still on the runway
   ✓ Landing gear touching the ground
   ✓ Not moving at all initially

3. Press W to increase throttle
   - Plane should start accelerating down the runway
   - Build up speed (around 175-200 for takeoff)
   - Pull back (Down Arrow) to rotate and lift off

4. Once airborne, press F to retract flaps

TAKEOFF PROCEDURE:
------------------

1. Full Throttle: Hold W until throttle is at 100%
2. Accelerate: Let plane build speed on runway (watch airspeed)
3. Rotate: At ~175-200 speed, press Up Arrow to pitch up
4. Liftoff: Plane should leave the ground
5. Climb: Continue Up Arrow input, press F to retract flaps
6. Fly: Use arrow keys to control flight

TROUBLESHOOTING:
----------------

Problem: Plane falls through runway
Solution: 
  - Check runway has a collider component
  - Increase F15 Y position slightly
  - Ensure landing gear colliders are enabled

Problem: Plane tips over on start
Solution:
  - Check plane rotation is level (X=0, Z=0)
  - Adjust center of mass in Rigidbody
  - Make sure landing gear is properly positioned

Problem: Plane won't accelerate
Solution:
  - Check Initial Speed is 0 (not negative)
  - Press W to increase throttle
  - Check that plane isn't stuck in terrain

Problem: Can't take off
Solution:
  - Need more speed (175-200 minimum)
  - Press F to deploy flaps for more lift
  - Pull back (Up Arrow) more gently
  - Ensure throttle is at 100%

QUICK SETTINGS SUMMARY:
-----------------------

F15 Transform:
  Position: (0, 2, -2500) [adjust Y and Z as needed]
  Rotation: (0, 0, 0) [adjust Y to match runway direction]
  Scale: (1, 1, 1)

F15 Plane Script:
  Initial Speed: 0
  Flaps Deployed: ✓ (optional, for easier takeoff)

That's it! You'll now have a realistic runway takeoff experience!
