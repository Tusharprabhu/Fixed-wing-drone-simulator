KEYBOARD CONTROLS - CONFIGURATION VERIFIED
==========================================

✅ ALL KEYBOARD CONTROLS HAVE BEEN CONFIGURED!

The PlayerInput.inputactions file has been updated with complete keyboard bindings.

VERIFIED KEYBOARD CONTROLS:
---------------------------

✅ W / S - Throttle Up / Down
   - Configured as 1D Axis composite
   - W increases throttle
   - S decreases throttle

✅ Arrow Keys - Pitch & Roll
   - Up Arrow = Pitch UP (nose up)
   - Down Arrow = Pitch DOWN (nose down)
   - Left Arrow = Roll LEFT
   - Right Arrow = Roll RIGHT

✅ Q / E - Yaw (Rudder)
   - Q = Yaw LEFT
   - E = Yaw RIGHT

✅ F - Toggle Flaps
   - Press F to deploy/retract flaps
   - Flaps increase lift but also drag

✅ Space - Fire Missile
   - Changed from ToggleAI to FireMissile
   - Space bar now fires missiles

✅ Left Mouse Button - Fire Cannon
   - Hold to fire continuous cannon bursts
   - Release to stop firing

✅ H - Toggle Help
   - Shows/hides help dialogs

ADDITIONAL NOTES:
-----------------

⚠️ IMPORTANT CHANGES MADE:
- Space bar was previously bound to "ToggleAI" (not needed for player-only mode)
- Space bar is now bound to "FireMissile"
- ToggleAI moved to backtick/tilde key (`) but AI is removed anyway

WHAT TO DO IN UNITY:
--------------------

1. RELOAD THE INPUT ACTIONS:
   - In Unity, click on the PlayerInput.inputactions file in the Project window
   - You should see "Re-import" or the file will auto-reload
   - If not, right-click the file and select "Reimport"

2. VERIFY PLAYER OBJECT SETUP:
   - Select "Player" in Hierarchy
   - Check Inspector for "Player Input" component
   - Should have "Actions" field pointing to "PlayerInput"
   - Behavior should be "Invoke Unity Events"

3. TEST THE CONTROLS:
   - Press Play in Unity
   - Test each control:
     □ W/S for throttle
     □ Arrow keys for pitch/roll
     □ Q/E for yaw
     □ F for flaps
     □ Space for missiles
     □ Left mouse for cannon
     □ H for help

TROUBLESHOOTING:
----------------

Problem: Controls not responding
Solution: 
  - Check that AI Controller is removed from F15
  - Verify Player Input component has correct action asset
  - Reimport PlayerInput.inputactions file
  - Check Console for Input System errors

Problem: Space bar does nothing
Solution:
  - Verify Space is now bound to FireMissile (not ToggleAI)
  - Check that missiles are configured on the plane
  - Look for hardpoints on F15 model

Problem: Wrong controls activating
Solution:
  - Close and reopen Unity to refresh input system
  - Check for duplicate input bindings
  - Verify action names match script callbacks

ALL SET! Your keyboard controls are fully configured and ready to use!
