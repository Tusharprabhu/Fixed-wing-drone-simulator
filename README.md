# Flight Simulator - Unity Project

A realistic flight simulator built in Unity featuring an F-15 fighter jet with authentic physics, keyboard controls, and a comprehensive HUD display.

## Overview

This is a physics-based flight simulator focused on delivering a realistic flying experience. The project features an F-15 fighter jet with accurate aerodynamics, starting from a runway takeoff to full flight control. All weapon systems have been removed to focus purely on the flight simulation aspect.

## Features

- **Realistic Flight Physics** - Lift, drag, thrust, and G-force calculations based on actual aerodynamics
- **Keyboard Controls** - Full flight control using W/S for throttle, Arrow keys for pitch/roll, Q/E for yaw
- **Runway Start** - Plane begins stationary on the runway for realistic takeoff experience
- **Real-time HUD** - Displays airspeed, altitude, angle of attack, G-force, throttle, health, and heading
- **Control Surfaces** - Working ailerons, elevators, rudder, flaps, and airbrakes
- **Afterburner Effects** - Visual effects at high throttle settings

## Controls

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| W/S | Throttle Up/Down |
| ↑/↓ | Pitch Up/Down |
| ←/→ | Roll Left/Right |
| Q/E | Yaw Left/Right |
| F | Toggle Flaps |
| H | Toggle Help |

## Quick Start

1. Open project in Unity 2021.3.10f1 or later
2. Load the Main scene
3. Press Play
4. Use W to throttle up, build speed to 175-200 knots
5. Press Up Arrow to take off
6. Fly!

## HUD Information

All flight data is displayed in the top-right corner:
- Airspeed (knots)
- Altitude (feet)
- Angle of Attack (degrees)
- G-Force
- Throttle (visual bar)
- Health (visual bar)
- Heading (compass degrees)
